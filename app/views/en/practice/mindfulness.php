<a name="monday"></a><h3>About our Monday Sangha meeting format</h3>
We meet twice on Mondays for between 1 and 2 hours, following our Sangha format:
<ol>
    <li>20-25 minute seated meditation, or feel free to do walking meditation if you prefer.<br/>
        (Note: If your computer can receive streaming audio and/or video you are often invited to share in a guided meditation).</li>
    <li>Reading of <a href="the-5-mindfulness-trainings">the 5 Mindfulness Trainings</a>.</li>
    <li>Discussion for the rest of the hour to 2 hours for those who wish to stay with the discussion.<br/>
        (We also, sometimes, contemplate a reading by Thay during part of this period).</li>
</ol>

<p>We have adopted the following guideline to make our online discussion more efficient:</p>

<p>Just as in face to face Sangha, we use the bow as a signal that we would like to speak. When you wish to speak, type in the word "Bow" and post it so the group knows you wish to speak. Then type your comments and post them, taking as much time as you need. When you are finished speaking post the word "Bow" again to let everyone know when you are finished.</p>

<p>This allows each of us to speak without interruption. This also allows us to follow our breath and practice being mindful, fully present, as we wait for the person typing to post their message.</p>

<p>This e-version of a sangha is a different way of communication, one many of us are not used to. Yet we have found it to be a very viable way to connect with like-minded people looking for Sangha connection.</p>
