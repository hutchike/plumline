<p>
So far in this series, we've explored concentrating the mind and opening to or 
meeting different aspects of our experience --physical sensations, feeling, 
mind-states and thoughts-- with mindfulness, this quality of non-judgmental 
awareness. Now the fun of practice actually begins. We will start using these 
tools to work with aspects of our lives that interfere with our ability to rest 
in awareness and that leave us in suffering.
<p>
The Five Hindrances are:<br>
1. Sense-desire, lust or greed<br>
2. Hatred, anger, aversion or fear<br>
3. Sloth and torpor or sleepiness and sluggishness<br>
4. Restlessness and worry or agitation in the mind and body<br>
5. Doubt or uncertainty
<p>
These qualities of mind and body are called hindrances because when we 
are caught up in them, they hinder or interfere with the development of 
concentration and mindfulness. 
This process of getting caught in the hindrances involves 
<a href="thinking.html#clinging" target="_blank">clinging</a> to or 
identification with the mind and body states characteristic of the 
hindrance. When we are identified, we have lost our ability to 
experience a thought or physical experience as an object of 
awareness. Instead, we are caught in believing that what we are 
thinking or experiencing is who we are. Or, we are caught in believing 
that what we are thinking or experiencing is who or what the other 
person or thing is.
<p>
Identification with the Hindrances is a common, probably universal, 
impediment to practice. For one's practice to progress and bear the 
fruit of freedom from suffering, one must learn to work skillfully with 
the Hindrances. There are a variety of instructions for dealing with 
these different hindrances, a variety of skillful means. Some of the 
instructions for working with specific hindrances will be covered 
below. However, since this is only meant as an introduction, this 
will not be a comprehensive list of skillful responses.
<p>
<i>The Primary Instruction</i>
<p>
The primary instruction for each hindrance is the same: first to 
recognize it, then to meet it with acceptance, mindfulness and 
investigation, the quality of curiosity.
<p>
In order to let go of resistance and to bring acceptance, mindfulness 
and investigation to an experience, first we simply have to recognize 
that it is present. So recognition is the first step. As we explore 
each hindrance, we will begin with a description of what it is.
<p>
Acceptance is a crucial step in working with a hindrance. It is crucial 
because we cannot come to understand what lust is, or what fear is, if 
we are constantly pushing it away or holding it so tightly that we 
won't let it go away. If we won't let it be what it is in the first 
place, then we will not be able to see, to experientially know, 
what it is. Also, until we can accept the existence of a hindrance 
as part of our experience, we will be caught in holding on to it 
(greed) or pushing it away (aversion). In other words, we will be 
caught in a hindrance towards the hindrance, such as having aversion 
for aversion. Non-acceptance piles one hindrance on top of another. 
So before we do anything else, there has to be an acceptance that 
<i>this</i> is what is present in our lives <i>in this moment</i>. It is important 
to understand that acceptance doesn't mean that we act it out. Acting 
on a hindrance would mean that we are continuing to identify with it, 
that we are stuck in it. So this form of acceptance includes renunciation 
or letting go of acting on the experience. Acceptance involves a 
realization that an experiential understanding of the hindrance as 
an object of awareness is a necessary step in becoming free of the hindrance.
<p>
The second quality that we bring to the hindrances is mindfulness. It is 
the quality of seeing something just as it is. It is the quality of 
allowing <i>this</i> to reveal itself just as it is. It is not a doing but 
rather a receptivity to seeing and experiencing. If acceptance can be 
viewed as allowing <i>this</i> to penetrate into awareness so that it can be 
known, then mindfulness can be regarded as penetrating <i>this</i> in order 
to know it. It is known through bare attention. Attention that is bare 
of judgment about whether it is good or bad, useful or a useless. 
Attention that is bare of decision-making about the hindrance. Attention 
that is bare of commentary or story-telling about the hindrance. It is a 
seeing or a receptive knowing that this is what is present at this moment.
<p>
Acceptance and mindfulness allow us, then, to investigate our experience 
of the hindrance. Investigation is not an analytical process. It is 
curiosity about what is being experienced at this moment. <i>What is this?</i> 
Investigation allows us to see what the hindrance is and to truly come 
to understand for ourselves: This is what sense-desire, or any other 
hindrance, is. This is how I experience it in the body at this moment. 
This is how it affects the mind. The more we are able to investigate a 
hindrance and come to understand how we experience it, the more easily 
we will tend to recognize it when it arises into our experience.
<p>
<i>Sense-Desire</i>
<p>
We've all been naturally endowed with the ability to experience contact 
with certain sense objects. For most of us, these abilities include organs 
for seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching. Buddhist psychology 
includes a sixth organ, the brain or mind for cognizing or thinking. When 
a sense object, such as a sight, a sound, an odor, a taste, pressure or a 
thought, has contact with a sense organ, one response to the contact is 
for desire to arise. Desire for more contact with the object. There might 
be desire to continue hearing the sound of a bell as it fades away. There 
might be desire to look at a colorful sunset after spending a long day 
meditating.
<p>
Sense-contact and sense-desire are not a problem. The problem is not being 
aware that sense-desire is what is present in this moment. The problem is 
getting caught in clinging to the sense-desire, getting caught in it or 
identified with it. 
<p>
In addition to the primary instruction of meeting sense-desire with 
recognition, acceptance, mindfulness and investigation, it is especially 
useful to bring the practices of renunciation and investigation to this 
hindrance. Because there is such strong cultural and biological conditioning 
to seek and consume pleasant sense experiences, the intention to renounce, to 
let go of, sense-desire is a necessary counterbalance and is essential if 
we are to understand how we get caught in this hindrance. 
<p>
Two forms of investigation are helpful with this hindrance. Investigation 
of the impermanent nature of the sense-object will help to undermine the 
tendency to grasp which is based on the belief that we can obtain a kind 
of permanent satisfaction from it. When we bring mindfulness and 
investigation to the feeling-tone associated with sense contact, we can 
experience and see for ourselves the strong conditioning in the mind to 
grasp the sense objects that are pleasant. At the same time, the simple 
act of bringing mindfulness to this process allows us to disrupt this 
grasping. The moment of mindfulness breaks the chain of causation linking 
pleasant feeling-tone and grasping, helping to de-condition this hindrance. 
If grasping the particular sense-object is strongly conditioned, then it 
may have to be met with mindfulness repeatedly to have a noticeable effect, 
but over time the difference can be seen.
<p>
<i>Hatred or Aversion</i>
<p>
Another possible set of  responses to sense contact is hatred, fear, anger 
or aversion, in other words a desire to avoid, push away or destroy the sense 
object. An example would be experiencing an itch on the face as one is 
meditating. Rather than investigating this sense experience with mindfulness, 
one might actually scratch the itch in an attempt to make it go away or one 
might physically tighten in an attempt to resist and control the itch. Another 
example would be when a thought or emotional memory that is unpleasant begins 
to arise into awareness, rather than experiencing it and seeing it with 
mindfulness, one might respond by getting angry and blaming another person 
for the experience.
<p>
Once again the problem is not hatred or aversion itself. The problem is the 
lack of awareness that aversion is what is present in this moment. The problem 
is getting caught in clinging to the aversion, getting caught in the aversion 
or being identified with it. 
<p>
Aversion is resistance to the sense contact. Resistance is a form of clinging 
because we have to cling to or grab onto the object in order to push it away. 
Often this clinging takes the form of a judgment that the sense contact is 
not ok. There may also be a judgment that aversion is not ok, especially if 
one has learned that one ³should² let go. So, it is important to recognize 
aversion even if it is aversion to the aversion.
<p>
The first place to start in working with hatred or aversion is to attempt to 
follow the primary instructions of recognition, acceptance, mindfulness and 
investigation. As with sense-desire, it is also especially useful to bring 
the practices of renunciation and investigation to the hindrance of hatred 
or aversion. Because there is such strong cultural and biological conditioning 
to push away and avoid unpleasant sense objects, the intention to renounce the 
aversion and to know what is present, rather than acting out the resistance, 
counterbalances this conditioning. These practices are essential if we are to 
understand how we get caught in this hindrance. Other ways of describing 
renunciation and investigation are: to let go, to open, to experience, to 
endure and to know.
<p>
When investigating aversion, it can be helpful to notice the state of the 
mind and the body when aversion is present and when it is absent. The 
experience of aversion is often described as a contraction or tightening 
of mind and body. Investigation of the impermanent nature of the sense-object 
will help to undermine the tendency to push away which is based on the belief 
in the permanence of the sense-object and the contact with it. When we bring 
mindfulness and investigation to the feeling-tone associated with sense contact, 
we can experience and see for ourselves the strong conditioning in the mind to 
push away the sense objects that are unpleasant. At the same time, the simple 
act of bringing mindfulness to this process allows us to disrupt this pushing 
away. The moment of mindfulness breaks the chain of causation linking unpleasant 
feeling-tone and pushing away, helping to de-condition this hindrance. If 
pushing away the particular sense-object is strongly conditioned, then it 
may have to be met with mindfulness repeatedly to have a noticeable effect, 
but over time the difference can be seen.
<p>
If we think we are meeting the aversion with mindfulness and it persists, it 
is often helpful to look to see if there is a resistance to being aversive. 
This resistance to aversion or judgment about being aversive is often where 
the energy arises that keeps the aversion arising again and again.
<p>
When there is not sufficient mindfulness to simply meet the aversion, there 
is another option. In this situation, it is skillful to replace the aversion 
with thoughts of loving-kindness or metta, a mind-state that will be explored 
more in the next part of the Basics series.
<p>
<i>Sloth and Torpor</i>
<p>
Sloth and torpor or sleepiness and sluggishness is one of the hardest hindrances to recognize. It is so pleasant to fall asleep, to give in to the tug of falling asleep, that one often doesn't recognize this hindrance until after the fact. - Oops, I was asleep. It is important to notice if there is a judgment, if there is aversion about having fallen asleep, or if one can just see that non-judgmentally. If one can catch the sleepiness at the beginning and meet it with acceptance, mindfulness and investigation this will actually bring energy to the experience which helps to counteract the sleepiness.
<p>
There are two basics reasons that we fall asleep while we are meditating. One reason, which is particularly common in the evening or during the first day or so of a retreat, is that we are physically tired. Most people in our society lead very busy lives and are constantly being bombarded with a variety of stimuli. On top of this stress, most people don't get enough sleep. So, when we slow down and get quiet, there is a tendency to regard this as a signal that it is time to sleep.
<p>
Sleepiness and sluggishness may arise, though, even when one is not tired. In these circumstances it is usually a sign that there is resistance to being awake to something in our experience, something that is attempting to come into awareness. 
<p>
In working with this hindrance it is extremely important to have a strong intention to stay awake. This is the foundation that allows one to meet this hindrance with acceptance without being pulled into it by the pleasantness of sleep. Then, if one is able to meet the sleepiness with mindfulness and curiosity, this increase in interest should provide the energy needed to counteract the hindrance. If one is not physically tired, or if one is not sure whether there is resistance to being awake to something, then it is useful to investigate beyond the experience of sleepiness. This involves ³holding a space² for whatever might be hiding to come into the light of awareness.
<p>
There are other skillful things that one can do to increase energy. Some of these include:
<ul>
<li type=disc> Holding the breath as long as one can and then quietly exhaling. Repeating this 3-4 times.
<li type=disc> Tugging on the earlobes.
<li type=disc> Twirling the tongue around the inside of the mouth, passing over the fronts and back of the teeth, while keeping the lips closed.
<li type=disc> Opening the eyes to allow more light to enter, without focusing on anything in particular.
<li type=disc> Standing up and then continue to meditate while standing with the eyes at least partially open.
<li type=disc> If all else fails, then perhaps it would be best to take a nap and just get more rest.
</ul>
<p>
<i>Restlessness and Worry</i>
<p>
If the hindrance of sloth and torpor is an expression of insufficient energy, 
the hindrance of restlessness and worry is an expression of too much energy. 
It is characterized by quickly changing thoughts (often called Monkey Mind), 
anxiety, worry and excessive energy in the body such as twitches, itches and 
difficulty sitting still. Whether the hindrance is expressed mentally or physically 
there is an agitation, an unsettled feeling that can be quite unpleasant.
<p>
One of the impediments to recognizing that one is caught in this hindrance is the 
reaction to its unpleasantness. Often there is a reaction of aversion. The aversion 
may actually be contributing more energy to the restlessness even though one is 
attempting to avoid the unpleasantness. After recognizing that this hindrance is 
present, it sometimes takes courage to sit with it and to meet it with acceptance, 
mindfulness and investigation. 
<p>
Just as sleepiness may be an indication that there is resistance to something that 
is attempting to come into awareness, restlessness may also indicate this. In order 
to open to whatever is attempting to rise into awareness, one must learn to work 
skillfully with the excess energy. 
<ul>
<li type=disc> If experiencing it in the body, once recognized then investigate the 
feeling-tone of the experience.<br>
 -	Is it pleasant, unpleasant or neutral?<br>
-	Is there are reaction within the body to this feeling-tone?<br> 
-	Is it possible to relax into this sensation? This is sometimes referred to as 
surrendering or dying into it.<br>
-	If you are on retreat, one way of  working with excessive energy is through 
walking meditation.
<li type=disc> If there is a lot of agitation in the mind, sometimes it is more helpful to use sound as the meditation object rather than the breath. Sometimes the effort to focus on the sensations of breathing as the object of meditation can leave us cramped. Using sound as the object of meditation can lead to a greater sense of spaciousness. The spaciousness allows a sense of relaxation to develop which counterbalances the restlessness and worry.
<li type=disc> It can also be useful to investigate if there is an attitude of striving present. This can lead to too much energy. A skillful response would be to let go and relax a bit in one's effort.
</ul>
<p>
<i>Doubt</i>
<p>
Doubt is traditionally defined as doubt in the teacher or the teachings, but 
it may also include doubt about one's own ability to do the practice, doubt 
about whether one is doing things right and uncertainty or doubt about whether 
what one is experiencing is what one thinks it is. For example, "Is this doubt?" 
and  "Am I being mindful or am I merely suppressing this desire?"
<p>
If one can recognize that doubt is present, one of the first skillful responses 
is to try to meet it with acceptance, mindfulness and investigation. One has to 
be careful with the investigation. Exploring what doubt is does not mean exploring 
what the doubt is about, although sometimes it will be useful to look at this as 
well. Investigating doubt involves looking at what it is, recognizing that it is 
simply a thought arising in the mind.
<p>
Even if one recognizes that doubt is present and has some recognition that 
it is merely a thought, it can still be difficult to get unstuck from this 
hindrance. One of the basic antidotes to doubt is trust or faith in the practice. 
Trust arises from simply doing the practice over time and seeing how things come 
and go. Trust may also arise from a recognition that people have been successfully 
using these practices for over 2500 years. Trust may also be based on one's 
relationship with a teacher or spiritual friend. Trusting that the teacher will 
guide you in a way that is helpful. So if one is caught in doubt and is unable to 
get unstuck from it using mindfulness, it is often very helpful to speak to a 
teacher or spiritual friend whom you trust.
<p>
&nbsp;
<p>
Ultimately, it is the practice of mindfulness that frees us from these Hindrances. 
If we develop enough concentration, we may temporarily suppress them. But it is 
only by meeting them with mindfulness that we become free of them. When we open 
to the Hindrances and allow the experience to penetrate into our awareness and 
allow our awareness to penetrate into the experience, then we allow the sense-desire, 
the anger, the sleepiness, restlessness or the doubt to pass away through its own 
nature. When we see and experience this, then we have become free of this particular 
hindrance in this present moment. When we do this again and again, over time these 
hindrances slowly stop arising. The mind becomes naturally more concentrated and it is 
easier to find the peacefulness that is always present but often unrecognized.
